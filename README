This is a test/demo iOS program for uploading photos to Wikimedia Commons --
actually it uploads them to test.wikipedia.org. You can see uploaded files at
<http://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:NewFiles>

User credentials should be input on the settings flipside of the app before uploading.

Code implementing the MediaWiki web API is in the mwapi/ subdirectory -- you may adjust
these files or leave them as-is and just change the surrounding UI code.


Core exercises:

1) Detect login and upload errors and give feedback to the user.

2) After uploading, display a button that opens the new file in Safari;
   use URL format 'http://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:' + filename

3) Move i/o off the UI thread and provide visual progress feedback.


Bonus exercises:

* Use correct naming style for UI field properties in controller classes.

* When pulling existing images from the gallery, retrieve the original file via asset URL
  and upload that instead of recompression from a UIImage

* Rearrange UI into multiple steps: login, get photo, give description, upload.
